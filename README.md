# setups
Different copies of my setup files. Use them if you want ;-)


## Installations
I have installed `autojump`, which is a tool that learns from behavior and lets you jump around faster. You can install it with

```bash 
$ sudo apt-get install autojump
```

and then add `source /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh` to `~/.zshrc`.
