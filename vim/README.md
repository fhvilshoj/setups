## Vim 

For the new `.vimrc` file to work properly, on first need to install vundle:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

and then copy the `.vimrc` file from this repo to the root directory `~/`, open vim, and run 

```
:PluginInstall
```

This command should install the required plugins.
