# Installation of plugins

To install the plugins that the .zshrc file uses, run the following two commands: 

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
> git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

# Colortheme 

[Gogh](https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh) is a really nifty theme to install color themes in the terminal. You can use it like this: 

```bash
> bash -c  "$(wget -qO- https://git.io/vQgMr)"
```
